A anonymously hacker disclosure an exploit[1] of nvidia private driver
for GNU/Linux version:
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.full-disclosure/86747

According to the report, it should be get root as a local exploit. I
tested the exploit( which was attached) on SLED 11 SP2 with nvidia
private drvier 295.58. The result won't leads to get the root privilege
but it crashed the OS. This exploit doesn't work on nouveau( an open
source driver which was made by the procedure of reverse engineering of
Nvidia private driver)-_-

Marcus:"Thats also one reason why we push to keep /dev/nvidia not
writeable by users. (It is however due to the "video" group.)"

SLE 11 SP2 with kernel 3.0.38 used upstream fix now.

GNU/Linux local root exploit, firstly I recompiled a kernel 2.6.39
slackware and it was work. A kernel commit caused this security bug
last March:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=198214a7 , 

until the Jan 2012 the kernel mainline fixed the bug:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e268337dfe26dfc7efd422a804dbb27977a3cccc

I tested the exploit on SLED 11 SP2 and it doesn't work. Then I looked
through the kernel/fs/proc/base.c that it seems SUSE kernel's fix is
not come from the upstream fix though. According to the ChangeLog of
upstream fix, this bug was fixed in kernel-3.0.18(commit:
e268337dfe26dfc7efd422a804dbb27977a3cccc):

Here's paper to explain how the bug leads to a exploit:
