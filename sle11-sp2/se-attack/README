This is detail report for social engineering attack regression
testing.

19523-python-untrust-search-path.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
19523(python untrust search path), This one is a very intersting
social engineering attack and it does work in python 2 and python 3
environment.
 
I could'nt find the CVE yet. When a python program is trying to invoke
help("modules"), python will traverse the whole python modules which
was in /usr/xxx. Meantime, python will try to find the same module
name in the current directory. So, this is not a really software
exploit. But only a trick that attack might have the chance to do the
social engineering attack-_-
