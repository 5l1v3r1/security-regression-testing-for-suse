Some GNU/Linux virus/trojan analysis and test.

wirenet.1
password: "infected"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
wirenet.1 is a cross-platform trojan. In facto, it's a x-window based
keyboard logger. I got the GNU/Linux version's binary sample from
malware.lu community. They also provide a analysis report:
http://code.google.com/p/malware-lu/wiki/en_malware_wirenet

I took a glance at the disassembly code which generated by IDA Pro. It
seems doesn't have any infection feature. It's only a keyboard
logger. So, I think it's not a real virus.

OS: SLES 11 SP2
Firewall: disable
tools: tcpdump

Result: It won't send any packet to the internet machine when it
runs. Weird, it's not like what malware.lu's report.

btw: As I said, this is a cross-platform program. If you want to Mac
OSX/Windows samples, drop me a line: citypw@gmail.com or shchang@suse.com
